//! Audio level emitter for the on-screen visualizer
//!
//! During recording, the daemon buckets the live audio sample stream into
//! 10 ms windows (100 Hz) and emits a small binary frame for each window
//! over a Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voxtype/audio.sock`.
//!
//! Per-frame payload (16 bytes, native byte order):
//!
//! ```text
//! struct AudioFrame { seq: u32, min: f32, max: f32, peak_dbfs: f32 }
//! ```
//!
//! This is a lossy, best-effort broadcast: subscribers that fall behind get
//! disconnected. The daemon never blocks on slow consumers.
//!
//! The emitter is *additive*: it taps the existing
//! `mpsc::Receiver<Vec<f32>>` returned by `AudioCapture::start()` (which the
//! daemon used to discard). When recording stops, the input channel closes
//! and the emitter task exits, which in turn causes the bucketing loop to
//! end. The hub keeps running across recordings and accepts subscribers in
//! between, but only emits frames while a recording session has provided a
//! sample stream.
//!
//! ## Self-healing listener (issue #391)
//!
//! `LevelHub::start()` spawns two long-lived tasks (accept loop + broadcast
//! loop) that under normal operation never exit. If one of them does exit
//! (panic, runtime quirk, or an unforeseen bug), the listener gets dropped
//! silently: the socket file stays on disk but new `connect()` calls fail
//! with `ECONNREFUSED`. That orphaned-listener state was observed in the
//! wild on a long-running daemon and broke fresh OSD / audio-bridge
//! connections without any visible error in the daemon process.
//!
//! To make the failure both loud and survivable, the hub now:
//!
//! 1. Captures the `JoinHandle` for both tasks instead of letting them
//!    detach as fire-and-forget.
//! 2. Spawns a watchdog task that `await`s both handles via `select!`. If
//!    either resolves (which should be impossible through normal code
//!    paths) the watchdog logs at ERROR level and respawns the listener
//!    plus both internal tasks from scratch.
//! 3. Stores the live broadcast `Sender` behind a `Arc<RwLock<...>>` so
//!    `FrameSink::publish` always picks up the current sender after a
//!    respawn without recording sessions needing to be torn down and
//!    rebuilt. The lock is read-only on the hot path (one acquire per
//!    100 Hz frame), so the overhead is negligible.
//!
//! Pre-existing accepted connections do not migrate across a respawn;
//! their per-client writer tasks will see their queue receiver close and
//! exit cleanly. New clients connecting to the freshly-bound listener
//! work as if the daemon had just started. That's an acceptable trade-off
//! since the alternative is a permanently broken socket.
